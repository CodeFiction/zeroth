## Prerequisites
* Node installed (v6.2.0 has been verified, may work in earlier versions)

## Installation

Ubiquits uses a commandline tool `u` to initialize a new project, and manage the building/watching/deployment/debugging etc within it's own shell.

To get started, run the following command in your console *in an empty directory*:

```bash
npm install -g @ubiquits/toolchain && u
```

This will install the toolchain then initialize a new project by cloning the boilerplate, and running installation.

Once installation is complete, you will be taken on a brief tour of the features to get you familiarized with the cli.

For more information, visit the [cli guide page](/guide/cli)
